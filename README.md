# Voice Controlled Music Auditor

This console app takes an input directory and an output directory, recursively scans the input directory for MP3 files and then plays them back.

During playback you can use voice commands to audit the MP3's.

- `accept` will move the current file into the output directory.
- `delete` will delete the file permenantly.
- `skip` will move to the next song without making any changes.
